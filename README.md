# Villager Trade Reroller for Minecraft 26.3 (Fabric)

A client-side Fabric mod that rerolls librarian villager trades for you. It breaks and replaces the lectern, opens the trade screen, reads the enchanted books on offer, and stops as soon as it finds the book you asked for: Mending, Unbreaking III, Protection IV, or whatever else is on your list.

This is a fork of [Villager Reroll by Joplayz](https://github.com/Joplayz/villager-reroll-26.1.2), updated to Minecraft 26.3 and reworked so it holds up in survival on a multiplayer server. The reroll loop and the idea are Joplayz's. I fixed what broke for me on a survival server and added the things I kept wishing it had.

## What's different from the original

The original targets Minecraft 26.1.2 / 26.2. This version:

- Runs on **Minecraft 26.3** with Fabric Loader 0.19.5 and Fabric API 0.162.0.
- Finds your lectern in the hotbar, the offhand, or anywhere in your inventory. The original only checked the hotbar, so survival players who kept lecterns in the offhand or main inventory got `No lectern in hotbar!` and the mod stopped.
- Walks over to a lectern that drops out of pickup range, picks it up, and walks back to where you were standing. It sneaks the whole way, so it won't walk you off a ledge.
- Lets you pick the exact villager to reroll. Look at it and run `/reroll villager`, and only you will see it outlined. No more rerolling the wrong librarian in a crowded trading hall.
- Adds `/reroll` chat commands that run only on your client. Nothing is sent to the server, so you can set everything up without opening the config screen. This is handy when another mod (Wurst, for example) takes over the pause-menu button that Mod Menu normally uses.
- Lets you resize and move the HUD (scale 0.5 to 2.0, six screen positions, plus a one-line compact mode) so it stops covering the villager.
- Fixes a few bugs that show up in survival:
  - The set-position key now saves the empty space above the block you look at. Before, it saved the floor block itself, and placement failed with `Lectern position is blocked!`.
  - Trade offers from the previous attempt are cleared before each new one, so the mod never judges a villager by stale trades.
  - It stops before your axe breaks, and breaks the lectern by hand if you have no axe.

## Requirements

| Mod | Version |
|-|-|
| Minecraft | 26.3 |
| [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) | 0.19.5 or newer |
| [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) | 0.162.0+26.3 |
| [YetAnotherConfigLib (YACL)](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) | 3.9.7+26.3-fabric |
| [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) | 21.0.0 |

It's a client-only mod. The server doesn't need it installed.

## Install

1. Install the Fabric Loader for Minecraft 26.3.
2. Put Fabric API, YACL and Mod Menu in your `mods` folder.
3. Download the jar from the [Releases page](../../releases), or build it yourself (see below), and drop it into `mods`.

## Quick start

1. Hold some lecterns (hotbar, offhand or inventory all work) and an axe.
2. Stand next to an unemployed villager.
3. Look at the floor where the lectern should go and press **L** (or run `/reroll pos`).
4. Add what you want: `/reroll add mending 1 20` means Mending, any level, 20 emeralds or less.
5. Press **J** (or `/reroll start`). Press **K** or `/reroll stop` to stop.

When it finds a match, it stops, plays a sound, and removes that enchantment from your list. Move to the next villager and start again to hunt for whatever is left.

## Commands

Every command is client-side. Tab completion works for enchantment names and HUD positions.

## Things to know

- The auto-pickup walk goes in a straight line. It doesn't jump, climb or path around blocks. If something is in the way, it gives up after 10 seconds and tells you why.
- The mod turns your character to face the dropped lectern. Some anti-cheat plugins don't like sudden rotation. If your server complains, turn it off with `/reroll pickup false`.
- Check your server's rules before using any automation mod.

## Building from source

You need JDK 25.

```bash
./gradlew build
```

The jar ends up in `build/libs/`.
